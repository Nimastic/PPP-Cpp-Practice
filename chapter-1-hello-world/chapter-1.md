LLMs help to bridge these two
makes me realise that there's a micro and macro programming at moment
- micro programming: still your technical programming skills
- macro programming: your big concepts and ideas, breadth of information and domain you have to remember

c++ -o helloworld helloworld.cpp    # Creates "helloworld" executable

c++ / g++ is the same
-o output
helloworld is the programme name
helloworld.cpp is the file name
